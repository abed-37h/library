# Library

## Overview

This project is a part of the JavaScript course maintained by The Odin Project, Where we are supposed to build a website to organize a library.
Check the live demo [here](https://abed-37h.github.io/library)

## Features

- Add new books to the library
- Remove a book from the library
- Mark a book as read or unread
- Explore the available books in library

## Future additions

- [] Add a link to the actual book so that the user can browse and read it
- [] Add a sign up feature so that only admins can add and remove books and the users only read them

## What I've added to my skill set?

- Practiced JavaScript Objects and Object Constructors
- Learned how to style and manipulate dialog boxes
- Discovered and used the fact that I can handle form using JavaScript
- Learned how to save data into local storage
